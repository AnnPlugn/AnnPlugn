## Hello! My name is Anna Plygun, and I am currently studying Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation. As a passionate learner and 

# aspiring software developer, I aim to bridge the gap between theory and practice in the field of Artificial Intelligence.

About Me
I am deeply interested in the realms of programming and data science, with a particular focus on backend development and machine learning. My academic journey has equipped me with the foundational knowledge needed to tackle complex problems in this rapidly evolving field. I welcome opportunities to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of what is possible with technology.

Skills
Backend Development: I have hands-on experience with Django, and I am proficient in object-oriented programming. I am also familiar with containers using Docker, version control with Git, and building APIs with REST and FastAPI. I am in the process of systematizing my knowledge in these areas to enhance my development skills.
Databases: I have a solid understanding of SQL languages like PostgreSQL and MySQL, along with basic knowledge of MongoDB. I am keen on optimizing database interactions and improving data handling efficiency in my projects.
Algorithms: I enjoy tackling challenges on platforms like LeetCode, where I am capable of solving middle-level algorithmic problems. This experience allows me to refine my problem-solving skills and approach complex tasks methodically.
Machine Learning: While I acknowledge the need to strengthen my mathematical foundation, I have practical experience working with classical models and boosting algorithms. I am motivated to delve deeper into this fascinating field to enhance my capabilities in deep learning and artificial intelligence.
