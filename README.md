## âœ¨Hello! My name is Anna Plygun, and I am currently studying Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation.âœ¨

As a passionate learner and aspiring software developer, I aim to bridge the gap between theory and practice in the field of Artificial Intelligence.

## ðŸ”­About Me
I am deeply interested in the realms of programming and data science, with a particular focus on backend development and machine learning. My academic journey has equipped me with the foundational knowledge needed to tackle complex problems in this rapidly evolving field. I welcome opportunities to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of what is possible with technology.

# âš¡Skills
## Machine Learning:
While I acknowledge the need to strengthen my mathematical foundation, I have practical experience working with classical models and boosting algorithms. I am motivated to delve deeper into this fascinating field to enhance my capabilities in deep learning and artificial intelligence.

## Backend Development: 
I have hands-on experience with Django, and I am proficient in object-oriented programming. I am also familiar with containers using Docker, version control with Git, and building APIs 

## with REST and FastAPI. 
I am in the process of systematizing my knowledge in these areas to enhance my development skills.

## Databases: 
I have a solid understanding of SQL languages like PostgreSQL and MySQL, along with basic knowledge of MongoDB. I am keen on optimizing database interactions and improving data handling efficiency in my projects.
